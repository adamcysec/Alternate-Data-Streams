# Alternate-Data-Streams

## Synopsis
A suite of python tools to work with Alterndate Data Streams (ADS) in the NTFS file system.

## Description

The tools use [pyADS](https://github.com/RobinDavid/pyADS) from [RobinDavid](https://github.com/RobinDavid) to access the alternate data streams. I modified pyADS to work better with my tools, therefore I have uploaded to this repositiory.
